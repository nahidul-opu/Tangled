guava/11603.json: Miscellaneous documentation fixes and internal cleanups. - Remove potentially misleading "it cannot be started/stopped more than once" from Stopwatch exception messages. - Fix TreeTraverser ASCII art. - Remove inaccurate @GwtCompatible annotation from FeatureUtil. - Fix mistaken duplicate words ("the the," etc.). - Strip *all* of benchmark running instructions from CharMatcherBenchmark, and preemptively strip instructions from internal escapers benchmarks. - Remove test <echo> from ant section of pom.xml. - Add @Nullable to StandardBaseEncoding's other constructor's paddingChar parameter. - Remove stale comment from Futures. (UninterruptibleFuture is long dead.) - Update name of Truth GWT module. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=42036409

guava/81.json: Fix nonpublic identifiers and documentation that use "whitelist" or "blacklist" to use less problematic terms. RELNOTES=n/a ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=199834981

guava/22803.json: Fix Error Prone errors in GWT code. ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=115110183

guava/11748.json: Fix calls to contains(Object) and get(Object) that pass a value of apparently the wrong type. Tighten up some generics in other cases to make the type, which was correct after all, look more correct. BUGS: AbstractBiMapTester: - Fix inv.entrySet().contains(...) check, which was using the forward entry instead of the reverse. - Fix getMap().get(v) call to be an inv.get(v) call. - Use |reversed| instead of |entry| consistently for clarity. TypeToken: - Call map.get(K) instead of map.get(TypeCollector). (Presumably this was just an optimization and not necessary for correctness?) SIMPLIFICATIONS: TypeResolver: - forLookup always returns a (nullable) TypeVariableKey. Declare that return type instead of plain Object. (benyu@: I feel like we may have talked about this, with your expressing a preference for the Object type. But I can find no record of the discussion, so I could be making that up. If you do prefer Object, I won't push for the change.) ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=108994208

guava/2385.json: Delete WellBehavedMap. The bug it worked around was fixed in Java 7: https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6312706 And I don't believe it was ever present under Android: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore/+/fdb2704414a9ed92394ada0d1395e4db86889465/luni/src/main/java/java/util/EnumMap.java#146 I haven't looked for the absolute first version ever of GWT, but the still very old GWT file doesn't have the bug, either. Deleting this class will simplify some work I'm doing around our EnumMap usage for j2cl. RELNOTES=n/a ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=233418344

guava/11402.json: Optimize collapseFrom and trimAndCollapseFrom so that they only allocate if necessary. Add a few tests. Remove the GWT workarounds for GWT bug 4491 since it appears to be fixed.
