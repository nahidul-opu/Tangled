+        Fixed a memory leak in CombinedConfigurationBuilder. Builder for the
+        child sources were created each time a new result configuration was
+        requested; thus the list with child builders got longer and longer.
+        This also had an impact on reloading because unnecessary reloading
+        operations could be triggered. Now it is guaranteed that child builders
+        are created only once.
