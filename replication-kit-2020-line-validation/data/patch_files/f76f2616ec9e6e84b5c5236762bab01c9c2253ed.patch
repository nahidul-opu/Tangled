Subject: [PATCH] Changed DelegatingDatabaseMetaData to no longer add itself to
 the AbandonedTrace of its parent connection.  This was causing excessive
 memory consumption and was not necessary, as resultsets created by
 DelegatingDatabaseMetaData instances are attached to the parent connection's
 trace on creation. JIRA: DBCP-330 JIRA: DBCP-352
